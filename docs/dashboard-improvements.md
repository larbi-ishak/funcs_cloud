## ✅ Completed

### 2. Environment Variables for API URLs ✅ Done

Replaced all hardcoded `localhost:3002` URLs with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_METRICS_URL` env vars. Created `.env.local` with defaults.

### 3. Input Validation on Forms ✅ Done

Added `FN_NAME_REGEX` validation on deploy form with real-time red border + helper text. Added `IMAGE_REGEX` constant matching backend validation. Added JSON validation for env vars (already existed).

### 6. Remove Dead Dependencies ✅ Done

Removed `date-fns` (unused). Kept `recharts` for future chart use. Deleted 5 unused SVGs from `public/`.

### 7. Loading States ✅ Done

Added `loading.tsx` for root, `/workers`, and `/metrics` routes with skeleton/spinner components.

### 9. Error Boundaries ✅ Done

Added `error.tsx` at root level with "Something went wrong" UI + retry button.

### 11. Dark Mode Toggle ✅ Done

Added `ThemeToggle` component in header. Toggles `dark` class on `<html>`, persists preference in `localStorage`.

### 12. Metrics Page ✅ Done

Created `/metrics` page that fetches Prometheus metrics from gateway's `/metrics` endpoint (port 3003). Displays:
- Key metric cards (avg latency, total requests, cache hits, rate limited)
- Process metrics (uptime, memory, heap usage)
- Latency distribution histogram
- Warm pool size gauge
- Collapsible raw Prometheus output

Auto-refreshes every 10s.

### 13. Confirmation Dialogs ✅ Done

Added `confirm()` dialogs before deleting functions and removing workers with descriptive messages.

### 14. Image Name Validation ✅ Done

Added `FN_NAME_REGEX` client-side validation on deploy form with real-time feedback (red border + helper text).

## 📋 Remaining Items (Documented)

### 1. Dashboard Authentication — Deferred

**Problem:** Anyone who can reach the dashboard URL has full admin access.

**Status:** Next.js 16 deprecated `middleware.ts` in favor of `proxy.ts` with a new API. The middleware file was causing errors. Removed for now. Re-implement using Next.js 16 `proxy.ts` convention when auth is needed.

**PostgreSQL-ready:** Independent of DB driver. Can upgrade to session-based auth when PG migration happens.

---

### 4. Data Caching with SWR ✅ Done

Replaced all `fetch()` + `useEffect` + `setInterval` patterns with `useSWR()`. Benefits: request deduplication, stale-while-revalidate, focus revalidation, no render thrashing. Centralized fetcher in `src/lib/fetcher.ts`.

---

### 5. Real-Time Updates via SSE

**Problem:** Dashboard polls every 5s. Worker health, container status, and warm pool size change more frequently.

**Plan:** The deploy page already uses SSE — extend to other pages. Or use SWR's `refreshInterval` for simpler polling.

**Effort:** ~1 hour

---

### 8. Shared Component Library ✅ Done

Created `src/components/` with:
- `StatusBadge` — color-coded status badges for all entity states
- `MetricCard` — stat display cards with label/value/unit
- `PageHeader` — consistent page titles with description + actions
- `ConfirmDialog` — modal confirm dialog + `useConfirm()` hook

---

### 10. Proper TypeScript Types ✅ Done

Created `src/types/api.ts` with interfaces for all API entities (NovaFunction, Worker, Container, Invocation, Event, etc.) and response wrappers. PostgreSQL-ready: IDs are `string` (works for both text IDs and future UUIDs), timestamps are ISO strings.

---

### 15. Next.js API Proxy Routes (BFF)

**Problem:** Browser makes direct calls to the placement service, exposing the backend URL and preventing server-side auth.

**Plan:** Add Next.js API routes as a proxy:
```
Browser → Next.js /api/* → Placement Service
         (adds auth headers, hides backend URL)
```

**Effort:** ~2 hours

---

### 16. No Tests

**Problem:** Zero test coverage.

**Plan:** Add Playwright for E2E tests + Vitest for unit tests.

**Effort:** ~4 hours

---

### 17. Polling Anti-Pattern → SWR ✅ Done

Merged with item 4. All pages now use `useSWR()` with `refreshInterval: 5000`. SWR handles: request deduplication, stale-while-revalidate, focus revalidation, and shallow comparison to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

---

### 18. Zombie SSE Stream (AbortController Leak)

**Problem:** In `deploy/page.tsx`, the `handleDeploy` function starts an SSE stream with a `while(true)` loop. If the user navigates away during deployment, the component unmounts but the fetch promise continues running — processing chunks into a `setLogs` setter for a component that no longer exists. This causes React memory leak warnings and wastes resources.

**Plan:** Bind the deployment fetch to an `AbortController` and abort on unmount:
```tsx
const abortRef = useRef<AbortController | null>(null);

// In handleDeploy:
abortRef.current = new AbortController();
const response = await fetch(url, { signal: abortRef.current.signal, ... });

// In useEffect cleanup:
useEffect(() => {
  return () => abortRef.current?.abort();
}, []);
```

**Effort:** ~30 minutes

---

### 19. Unbounded File Upload (Browser Crash)

**Problem:** The deploy form allows directory upload via `<input webkitdirectory>`. While it filters `node_modules` and `__pycache__`, selecting a Python `venv/` folder with 15,000 files will:
1. Load 15,000 `File` objects into React state synchronously
2. Parse all 15,000 paths into the file tree
3. Render 15,000 `FileTreeNode` DOM elements
4. Freeze/crash the browser tab

**Plan:**
1. **Hard limit:** Enforce max 500 files and max 50MB total size before setting state
2. **Truncate display:** Show first 50 files in the tree with a "+N more files" message
3. **Future:** Use `@tanstack/react-virtual` for virtualized rendering if large trees are needed

```tsx
if (selected.length > 500) return alert("Too many files. Limit is 500.");
const totalSize = selected.reduce((sum, f) => sum + f.size, 0);
if (totalSize > 50 * 1024 * 1024) return alert("Total size exceeds 50MB limit.");
```

**Effort:** ~30 minutes

---

### 20. Replace `alert()` with Toast Notifications ✅ Done

Installed `sonner`. Added `<Toaster />` to root layout. Replaced `alert()` calls with `toast.success()` / `toast.error()` across all pages.
